## 🌐🛡️ Azure Virtual Desktop Disaster Recovery Plan

### 📄 Overview
This Disaster Recovery (DR) plan focuses on maintaining seamless service during regional disruptions for the Azure Virtual Desktop environment. Our strategy involves a primary host pool in West US 2 and a new active host pool in Central US or West US, facilitating load distribution and high availability.

### 🎯 Objectives

- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Immediate failover (<2 hours)
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Real-time synchronization (<2 hours)

### 🌟 Current Setup

- Primary Region: West US 2
- Primary Host Pool: THS Host Pool

### 🚧 Expansion and DR Activation

- Secondary Region: Central US or West US (TBD)
- Secondary Host Pool: To be established as an active host pool

### 🔧 Implementation Steps

#### Setting Up the Secondary Host Pool
- Action: Configure a secondary host pool in the selected secondary region.
- Details: Mirror the primary host pool’s setup, including apps, user groups, and permissions.

#### Data Synchronization and Replication
- Action: Implement real-time data replication between both host pools.
- Tools/Technologies: Use tools like Azure Site Recovery for seamless data sync.

#### Load Balancing and User Distribution
- Action: Evenly distribute users to optimize resource use and reduce latency.
- Theory: Utilize Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door for efficient traffic management. [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/service-architecture-resilience) (Question here is around user profile. We might be able to mirror storage accounts.)

### 🔄 Failover Procedure

- Action: Switch to the secondary host pool during a primary region outage.
- Monitoring: Set up Azure Monitor and Azure Service Health alerts for failover.

### 🧪 Testing the DR Plan

- Action: Conduct regular DR tests to verify failover efficiency.
- Frequency: Every six months or after major updates.

### 📚 Documentation and Training

- Action: Keep detailed DR strategy documentation and train IT staff and stakeholders.
- Details: Documentation should include process diagrams, contact lists, and escalation procedures.
