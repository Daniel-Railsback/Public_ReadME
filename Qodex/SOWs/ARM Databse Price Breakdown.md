## Summary: 
Due to issues with the worklist and posting notes, actions have been taken on the THS and LUHS ARM databases. Both databases have been scaled up to keep users productive while the team troubleshoots the issues to find long-term solutions. As a result of the scale change, the cost has increased for both databases.

This schedule can be adjusted to any time, but we leave the window open because we do not have a shift schedule for the users on the site. We are happy to change this to any schedule that fits.
