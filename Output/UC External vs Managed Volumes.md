# What is a Volume in Databricks

Volumes are a feature of Databricks similar to tables.  You get all the same benefit of security within Databricks, except volumes contain all sort of files not just data tables(Non-Tabluar). 


# Whatâ€™s the difference between Managed & External Volumes


## Managed 
Host on the same storage blob as UC
100% managed on UC dashboard
When dropped it is deleted from Azure(Requires owner permissions)
Less Maintenance 
Harder to assign costs


## External 
Creation of blob storage required in Azure portal
Blob recovery options managed by IT
Delete only from Azure portal
Can read DLT pipeline but CAN NOT write
