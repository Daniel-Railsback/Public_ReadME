# How are Tags in Azure useful
Tags are extremely useful when trying to keep organized and costs down in Azure. 

One of the best uses of Tags is cost filtering.  In the Azure cost center you can filter by tags. This provides a number of benefits such as: Faster loading in Azure cost center, easily assign costs to teams, track & project projects costs.  


# What is an Azure Policy


Azure Policies are a great tool for keeping organization in your Azure tenants. A person can set definitions or rules to evaluate resources.  In other words, this can be used to enforce rules onto our Azure resources.  

Examples: 
RG names must start with RG-
Resources must have specific tag present



# Who can create policies

**Resource Policy Contributor**: 
This role grant sufficient rights to apply policies. 

I believe this is required to be applied to the Tenant/Sub/RG/Resource you are applying the police too.
